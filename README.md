# Dealership Inventory Template

While I was in the market for a vehicle I was not impressed with the majority of layouts that dealerships have for browsing their inventory online.

So in my spare time over the course of a week I designed and created this layout using CSS Grid and Flexbox.

This layout features a responsive design with navigation and filters that are toggled when on mobile.
